      <h2>Why petting a bunny?</h2>

      <div class="pros-item">
        <h3>They are quiet.</h3>
        <p>
          The fact that bunnies make little to no noise is perfect, if you live
          in an apartment building or have nearby neighbors.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="pros-item">
        <h3>They have personalities plus.</h3>
        <p>
          People who have never had a rabbit as a pet donâ€™t realize that rabbits
          actually have very distinct personalities. These animals can be
          charming, affectionate and very interactive.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="pros-item">
        <h3>They bond closely with owners.</h3>
        <p>
          Bunnies recognize their owners by voice and sight and will even come
          on command. They may even follow their owners from room to room and
          jump up on their laps when called.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="pros-item">
        <h3>They need less space than other pets.</h3>
        <p>
          If you live in a small house or apartment and youâ€™re looking for a
          cuddly pet who doesnâ€™t require a lot of space and doesnâ€™t need to be
          walked, a rabbit may be right for you.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="pros-item">
        <h3>They are easily trained.</h3>
        <p>
          Using the principles of positive reinforcement training, rabbit owners
          can encourage their pets to learn certain behaviors repeatedly
          rewarding them with special treats when they perform these behaviors.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="pros-item">
        <h3>They are long-lived.</h3>
        <p>
          Pet rabbits, when housed indoors and cared for properly, can live
          eight to 12 years or even longer. Long life span is an attraction for
          many people looking for small non-cat/non-dog pets.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="pros-item">
        <h3>They come in all shapes, sizes and colors.</h3>
        <p>
          Given that there are more than 50 recognized rabbit breeds that vary
          in size, coat color, length and texture, there is a bunny breed for
          everyone.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="next-page"></div>

      <div class="pros-item">
        <h3>They are easy to rescue.</h3>
        <p>
          There are so many abandoned bunnies given up to rabbit shelters every
          year that rescuing a needy rabbit is a relatively easy thing to do.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="pros-item">
        <h3>They are clean.</h3>
        <p>
          They can easily be litterbox-trained and will generally keep
          themselves very clean with frequent grooming.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="pros-item">
        <h3>They are definitely cute.</h3>
        <p>Can you think of a cuter pet than a fuzzy little bunny?</p>

    <div class="behavior-section section" id="behavior">
      <h2>Do you understand bunnies' behaviors?</h2>

      <div class="behavior-item">
        <h3>Binky</h3>
        <p>
          A rabbit will binky when it feels really <em>happy or excited</em>.
          Binkying looks like a large jump in the air while the rabbit slightly
          twists its body and head at the same time. A binky can also look like
          a sharp flick of its head accompanied by a small ear wiggle. A rabbit
          that feels safe and secure in its home is more likely to binky around.
        </p>
        <p>
          You cannot teach your rabbit to binky as it is an inherent behavior.
          Rather, a rabbit will only binky when it feels like it. Additionally,
          a rabbit will have its own likes and dislikes when it comes to foods,
          toys, and ways of playing with you and other rabbits.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="behavior-item">
        <h3>Ear Shaking</h3>
        <p>
          This is when a rabbitâ€™s shakes their head to make their ears flop
          around a little. There are three reasons rabbits might do this.
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <em>They are happy.</em> Sometimes this is a mini binky and your
            rabbit is twitching their head to show they are happy. If your
            rabbit is happily running around and exploring, thatâ€™s usually what
            a little shake of their ears means.
          </li>
          <li>
            <em>They are swatting your hand away.</em> If you are reaching for
            your rabbit and trying to pet them, but they shake their ears as
            your hand gets close, they are probably trying to tell you they are
            not interested in being pet right now.
          </li>
          <li>
            <em>They have itchy ears.</em> If your rabbit shakes their head a
            number of times and then starts scratching at their ears, it means
            the ears are itchy.
          </li>
        </ol>
      </div>

      <div class="behavior-item">
        <h3>Zooming</h3>
        <p>
          This is when the rabbit races in circles, or figure eights, around the
          room over and over again. It means your rabbit is very
          <em>happy and excited</em> and theyâ€™re just full of energy. You might
          even see a few binkies as they zoom their way around the room.
        </p>

        <div class="next-page"></div>

        <p>
          Teemo usually zoom when I let him wander around in the living room,
          because sometimes I would go campus to study, so the opportunity for
          him to run is rare and precious! (Sorry Teemo)
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="behavior-item">
        <h3>Purring</h3>
        <p>
          Did you know rabbits can purr? Okay, itâ€™s not exactly the same as a
          catâ€™s purring. But if you listen very closely when you pet your
          rabbit, you might hear them softly grinding their teeth together. And
          if you put your hand on top of their head, youâ€™ll be able to feel a
          slight vibration. This is what rabbits do when they are
          <em>happy and content</em>. It means the same thing as a catâ€™s
          purring.
        </p>
        <p>
          I really enjoy feeling Teemo purring, cause I know he is enjoying my
          gentle stroking too.ðŸ˜Š
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="behavior-item">
        <h3>Grooming</h3>
        <p>
          This is the cutest thing you will ever see. Rabbits groom themselves
          all over. Youâ€™ll see them turning all the way around to groom their
          backside. And youâ€™ll also see them use their little paws to clean
          their face and ears.
        </p>
        <p>
          Rabbit cleaning habits are mesmerizing to watch. They are actually
          very clean creatures, and will spend a lot of their time grooming.
        </p>
        <p>
          After grooming, bunnies would become fluffy, that's so cuuuuute!!!ðŸ˜Š
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="behavior-item">
        <h3>Sprawling</h3>
        <p>
          This is when a rabbit is laying down on their side or belly, but is
          not completely flopped over. This is exactly what it looks like, your
          rabbit is <em>getting comfortable</em>. Sometimes theyâ€™ll even put
          their head down on their paws and look super cute while they sleep.
        </p>
        <p>
          Like flopping, sprawling is a good indication that your rabbit trusts
          you. Basically any point when your rabbits back feet arenâ€™t solidly on
          the ground, it means your rabbit feels safe. A rabbitâ€™s best defense
          is their ability to run away. When rabbits puts themselves in a
          position where they have to get up before running away, itâ€™s a big
          indicator that they see you as a friend, not a threat.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="next-page"></div>

      <div class="behavior-item">
        <h3>Flopping</h3>
        <p>
          A rabbit flop can actually look a little scary for new rabbit owners,
          but it doesnâ€™t have to be. Flopping is when rabbits throw themselves
          onto their side and sleep. Sometimes they even roll all the way onto
          their back.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is actually really adorable, and itâ€™s a sign that the rabbit
          feels completely safe. But it can be startling if youâ€™re not used to
          it, because it kind of looks like the rabbit is dead. But if you watch
          them closely, youâ€™ll see your rabbit is breathing.
        </p>
        <p>
          If youâ€™re a new rabbit owner and you see your rabbit laying on their
          side like this, donâ€™t worry! This is a sign your rabbit trusts you
          completely. Congratulations!
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="behavior-item">
        <h3>Loafing</h3>
        <p>
          Loafing is when your rabbit fluffs up into a ball and looks like a
          loaf of bread. This is generally a comfortable position for rabbits
          and theyâ€™ll often sleep in this position, especially in the colder
          months.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is a neutral position for a rabbit. They are not in a
          ready-to-run stance, but itâ€™s also an easy position for a rabbit to
          dash out of and make a run for it if they get scared. But donâ€™t worry
          if your rabbit seems to prefer sleeping in a loaf instead of sprawling
          or flopping. Many rabbits are just more comfortable this way.

      <h2>How to pick YOUR bunny?</h2>

      <p>
        There are 8 questions you should ask your breeder before buying a bunny.
      </p>

      <div class="choose-item">
        <h3>1. What breed is the rabbit?</h3>
        <p>
          This might seem like an obvious question, especially if you visit a
          breeder specializing in one breed. Itâ€™s always a good idea to
          double-check, though. Some non-reputable breeders will pass off
          look-alike rabbits as pedigree.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="choose-item">
        <h3>2. Is the rabbit socialized?</h3>
        <p>
          Depending on why youâ€™re buying a rabbit, whether itâ€™s for breeding,
          showing, or a family pet, asking about their socialization will tell
          you what to expect from your bunny. Some breeders donâ€™t interact with
          their stock, and the rabbits will be timid and unsure around people
          and other animals as a result.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you have children, other pets, or both, itâ€™s important to make sure
          your new rabbit will be at ease around them. Not only will your newest
          family member be more comfortable around you, but theyâ€™ll also settle
          into their new home much faster.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="choose-item">
        <h3>3. Does the rabbit have a pedigree?</h3>
        <p>
          A family pet doesnâ€™t necessarily need a pedigree or proof of lineage,
          especially if you have no plans to take your rabbit to competitions.
          However, if you do plan to take your rabbit to shows or even start
          your own in-home breeder business, youâ€™ll need to prove that your
          rabbit comes from good stock.
        </p>
        <p>
          Pedigree paperwork is an official way of claiming a certain bloodline.
          It proves that your rabbit comes from a long line of ancestors of the
          same breed. For shows and breeding registered pedigree rabbits, these
          papers are essential.
        </p>
        <p>
          Make sure your breeder keeps the pedigree documentation for their
          stock. They should include the paperwork with the price of your new
          rabbit.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="next-page"></div>

      <div class="choose-item">
        <h3>4. How much will the rabbit cost?</h3>
        <p>
          Pedigree animals are always more expensive than mixed breeds. Theyâ€™re
          highly sought after and backed by official directories that hold
          breeds to a particular standard and ensure that bloodlines arenâ€™t
          tampered with.
        </p>
        <p>
          You should know how much your new rabbit will cost before visiting so
          you donâ€™t get blindsided, but itâ€™s always a good idea to double-check
          before agreeing to pay anything.
        </p>
        <p>
          The cost of your rabbit will vary depending on age, breed, quality,
          and sex. Remember, reputable breeders include veterinary expenses,
          pedigree papers, and often a health guarantee in their asking price.
          Prices can range from anywhere between a few hundred to a few thousand
          dollars, and anything surprisingly cheap should give you pause.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="choose-item">
        <h3>5. How long has the breeder been raising rabbits?</h3>
        <p>
          An inexperienced breeder doesnâ€™t necessarily mean theyâ€™re not serious
          about their work. However, a more experienced breeder â€” with a history
          full of raising rabbits, if not breeding them â€” will be more familiar
          with the animal and the breed.
        </p>
        <p>
          Theyâ€™ll have a working knowledge of common issues of caring for
          rabbits. If itâ€™s your first time looking after rabbits, an experienced
          breeder will give you advice on how best to take care of your newest
          family member.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="choose-item">
        <h3>6. What food does the breeder use?</h3>
        <p>
          Asking what food the breeder uses serves two purposes. For new rabbit
          owners, itâ€™ll give you an idea of what to feed your new rabbit.
          Breeders worth their weight in gold will only choose high-quality food
          that will give their rabbits the nutrients and minerals that they
          need, along with ensuring a balanced diet.
        </p>
        <p>
          More experienced rabbit owners can use this question to find out if
          the rabbits in the breederâ€™s care are given proper meals. If a breeder
          turns out to be feeding their rabbits food that will cause them harm,
          it may cause long-lasting health issues down the line.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="next-page"></div>

      <div class="choose-item">
        <h3>7. How big will the rabbit grow?</h3>
        <p>
          Asking the breeder, particularly one whoâ€™s been breeding rabbits for
          years, will give you more insight into your new petâ€™s ancestry.
          Theyâ€™ll be able to give you a more accurate estimate of how large your
          rabbit will be.
        </p>
        <p>
          This particular question is also important due to any space
          constrictions at home. If you accidentally buy a giant ball of fur
          instead of a dwarf rabbit for your one-bedroom apartment, you may find
          yourself struggling to fit them into your home.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="choose-item">
        <h3>8. When is the rabbitâ€™s birthday?</h3>
        <p>
          Instead of asking how old the rabbit is, which can lead to
          unsatisfactory and vague responses, try asking for the rabbitâ€™s
          birthday. Breeders keep detailed records of every part of the breeding
          process, including birth records.
        </p>
        <p>Knowing the rabbit's birthday will tell you two things:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Whether the rabbit is 8 weeks old or not â€” any animal younger than
            this should not be taken away from their mother.
          </li>
          <li>
            How seriously the breeder takes record-keeping â€” if they canâ€™t keep
            track of birthdays, vet checks and pedigree certificates will be
            forgotten too.
          </li>
        </ul>
